# PenguinProject

This GitHub repository contains the data and code required to clean, analyse and save plots of a penguin dataset.

The functions used in the R markdown file are defined and sourced at the top of the R Markdown code. These functions can be found in the 'functions' file.

The raw data for analysis is required and can be found in the 'data_raw' file. The 'data_clean' and 'figures' files contain the output of the code.

The analysis tests a linear regression of body mass against culmen length but can be modified by changing the 'remove_NA' function in the ('cleaning' file) to the desired factors  and changing the linear model.

Make sure to download the entire repository to run the code locally.
